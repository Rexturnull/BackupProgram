# BackupProgram
This is a small DOS program to help me quickly perform data differential backup.

Here are two versions of the program, with **xcopy** being the older one and **robocopy** being faster and more updated.

1. Place this bat file in the source directory.
2. Enter the destination directory for the backup.
3. Enter "exit" to exit program.
